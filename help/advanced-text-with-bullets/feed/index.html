		<description><![CDATA[I was wondering if anyone knows how to get the hanging indent to work with a bulleted list?
When theres a paragraph with a bulleted list, and those bullets go on a couple of lines, the hanging indent doesnt come through on the template.
Any ideas? workarounds?

I tried moving theindent in manually, and tabbing in the subsequent lines, but when the text auto-resizes the indents and tabs dont.

Cheers]]></description>
