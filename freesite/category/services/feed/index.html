<p>Your real estate signs can be designed in two ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>From emailed photos and text using a simple order form. Typically delivered within 48 hours.</li>
<li>Secondly you can make up your own real estate sign from this website. Your template(s) need to be created and uploaded to the site and from there you can populate all the fields and load your photos. No proofing as delivery in as little as 24 hours.</li>
</ol>
<h2>HANDOUT CARDS &amp; FLYERS</h2>
<p>You can also opt to receive marketing cards and flyers. These are available separately or as part of your sign order. When ordered at the same time discounts on the package apply. There is a good price advantage in ordering on line with no limits on templates. The first two templates are provided at no charge.</p>

<p>Individually designed or from a template. If your organisation has three or more employees then we can set up an online template for you to fill out whenever you need business cards. Log on, type in your details and submit the order. We will process and deliver your business cards in 24 hours provided the order is received by midday, and at prices you wonâ€™t beat.</p>
<p>The business cards are digitally printed on 300gsm satin stock in full colour with reverse print options. We do not offer any other paper options online because digital processes make this difficult. The print is process colour so some spot colours will not be able to be matched. Ask for a sample to check colours.</p>
<p>If you want an individually designed business card, or you want us to create a unique template for you or your business, contact us on</p>
<p><strong>04 902 8700</strong> or email <a href="mailto:info@etgraphics.co.nz"><strong>info@etgraphics.co.nz</strong></a></p>
<h2>LETTERHEAD</h2>
<p>Short runs of letterhead are also a specialty. Pricing is very affordable and your repeat orders can be completed online with essential information able to be changed and proofed, all via the web.</p>
