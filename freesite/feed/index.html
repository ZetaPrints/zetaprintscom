Though it varies by print house, press operator, press manufacturer and press run, ink is typically applied in the order of the abbreviation.</p>
<p>The CMYK model works by partially or entirely masking certain <span class="mw-redirect">colors</span> on the typically white background (that is, absorbing particular <span class="mw-redirect">wavelengths</span> of light). Such a model is called <em>subtractive</em> because inks “subtract” brightness from white.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="float:left; padding:30px;" title="business-cards" src="../wp-content/uploads/2008/04/business-cards.jpg" alt="" width="266" height="200" /></p>
<p>Individually designed or from a template. If your organisation has three or more employees then we can set up an online template for you to fill out whenever you need business cards. Log on, type in your details and submit the order. We will process and deliver your business cards in 24 hours provided the order is received by midday, and at prices you won’t beat.</p>
<p>The business cards are digitally printed on 300gsm satin stock in full colour with reverse print options. We do not offer any other paper options online because digital processes make this difficult. The print is process colour so some spot colours will not be able to be matched. Ask for a sample to check colours.</p>
<p>If you want an individually designed business card, or you want us to create a unique template for you or your business, contact us on</p>
<p><strong>04 902 8700</strong> or email <a href="mailto:info@etgraphics.co.nz"><strong>info@etgraphics.co.nz</strong></a></p>
<h2>LETTERHEAD</h2>
<p>Short runs of letterhead are also a specialty. Pricing is very affordable and your repeat orders can be completed online with essential information able to be changed and proofed, all via the web.</p>
