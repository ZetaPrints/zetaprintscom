				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lets be partners</h2>
<p>Zetaprints is open for partnerships. We all can achieve more working together rather than against each other. Please, talk to us. We are always open for a discussion and new opportunities. There is more to web to print than meets the eye.<span id="more-59"></span></p>
<h2>Zetaprints technology</h2>
<p>We are happy to open up our back-end processes to other web-to-print service providers and ensure interoperability between the systems. It may be easier for you to use the power of our highly scalable back-end with your front-end interface.</p>
<h2>Web to print ideas</h2>
<p>Do you have a great idea or some specific application for our web to print technology?</p>
<p>No matter how big or small your idea is &#8211; we are all ears!</p>
<h2>Resellers</h2>
<p>The nature of our hosted web-to-print and dynamic imaging doesn&#8217;t allow much room for re-sale.</p>
<p>We cannot give exclusive rights over a market or a territory as anyone can just go and sign up with us directly.</p>
<h2>Value added resellers</h2>
<p>You can re-sell our web-to-print and dynamic imaging services if you add value customers are happy to pay extra for. For example some of our business customers do not want the overhead of managing their web-to-print portal and would like someone to take care of that. Other customers prefer to do the management work themselves, but want to outsource template creation.</p>
