				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We appreciate that managing your own web-to-print portal and preparing templates may look a bit difficult for a business that has nothing to do with graphic design or IT. We can help you manage it.<span id="more-950"></span></p>
<h2>Fully managed solution</h2>

All you need is someone with a bit of graphic design skills and We have many freelancers in our graphic design community who are happy to help with preparing and maintaining templates or creating new graphic designs. You can manage all the technical apects of your web-to-print portal yourself and outsource graphic design work to freelancers.</p>
<h2>Converting designs into templates</h2>
<p>It is easy to <a title="web-to-print conversion" href="../../../help/category/pdf-conversion/index.html">convert your existing graphic design files into templates</a>. For example, <a title="watch conversion demo" href="../../../help/flash/PDFtoCDRdemo6-1.html" target="_blank">converting a vector graphic design</a> from PDF to a template may take between 10min and 1 hour, depending on how clean the original design is.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Managing your graphic design needs with a large number of staff can be slow and costly. Probably your printer and your ad agency do it for you. It costs you money and makes you dependent on them.<span id="more-936"></span></p>
<h2>Template-based ordering</h2>
<p>Having a web-to-print portal with your branded designs makes it easy for your staff to order print, place ads or create display banners for Internet advertising. It is faster and cheaper to use our web-to-print service than using designers to make manual changes.</p>
<h2>Access control and approvals</h2>
<p>Access to your web-to-print portal is fully controlled by you. It can be open to any member of the staff or locked down with access by selected users only.</p>
<p>Output files generated by the portal can be sent directly to the intended recipient or go through a simple approval process.</p>
<h2>Security and integration</h2>
<p>Our service is fully hosted and sits outside your Intranet. However, it can be completely hidden from outsiders and accessed from within your corporate network only.</p>
<p>Integration of the portal into your Intranet applications such as CRM or procurement can make it even friendlier with a single sign on and information flow between the systems.</p>
<h2>Output for print or Internet</h2>
<p>Personalizing a business card design is not much different from personalizing an Internet banner. Our web-to-print system can handle both equally well. Banner advertising is a lot easier if you have the creatives prepared in minutes at negligible or no cost. It can even be done automatically with data from your DB or CMS.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you one of the lucky few to have a good close relationship with a responsive and inexpensive designer to help you and your staff?<span id="more-933"></span></p>
<h2>Casual designs</h2>
<p>We have <a title="design marketplace" href="http://zetaprints.com">lots of design templates</a> submitted by community of designers. You may well find just the design you need there.  It only costs you a fraction of what a custom made design would cost you and in none of the time. Find a design, personalize, pay a small fee (if any), download the files and it&#8217;s ready to be sent to printing, publishing or downloaded for whatever other purpose.</p>
<p>Did you know we have lots of <a title="design templates" href="http://zetaprints.com">free templates</a> you can use right now?</p>
<h2>Branded designs</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s cheaper and easier to turn your branded designs, such as business cards, ads, letterheads, etc into templates. You can make changes to it any time, anywhere yourself and you won&#8217;t need PhotoShop for it. Just enter text and upload images. It couldn&#8217;t be easier.</p>
<h2>Print or digital</h2>
<p>Your web-to-print portal can produce output for printing (PDF, hi-res Jpeg) or images for Internet advertising. Making changes to a business card or an Internet banner becomes so much easier!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Make it easy for franchisees to order all their personal business stationery, marketing collateral and help them do ad booking online in a simple and cost effective way.<span id="more-929"></span></p>
<h2>Brand control</h2>
<p>Our web-to-print service will put you in control of the branding and let franchisees be in control of parts of design they can personalize.</p>
<h2>Printing</h2>
<p>Final PDF output can be forwarded to your preferred print provider or it can be sent to the franchisee. Changing a print provider can be as easy as changing the email address of orders recipient in your web-to-print portal. Each product can be configured separately.</p>
<h2>Print advertising</h2>
<p>Ad creatives can be sent directly to a publication or to your headoffice for approval. Franchisees won&#8217;t need to worry who to send the files to or if the files are prepared the right way.</p>
<h2>Digital advertising</h2>
<p>Preparing a display banner in a web-to-print system is not much different from preparing a newspaper ad &#8211; only the output differs. Banner files can be downloaded or the whole process can be integrated into your ad management system.</p>
<h2>Payments</h2>
<p>Payments can be handled directly within the web-to-print portal using credit cards or PayPal. You can integrate the billing process with your accounting or CRM system and bill your franchisees separately.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><span id="more-925"></span><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993" title="Web-to-print businesses" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Web-to-print_businesses.gif" alt="Web-to-print process for businesses" width="430" height="218" srcset="http://www.zetaprints.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Web-to-print_businesses-150x76.gif 150w, http://www.zetaprints.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Web-to-print_businesses-300x152.gif 300w, http://www.zetaprints.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Web-to-print_businesses.gif 430w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></p>
<h2>Web-to-print templates</h2>
<p>Product templates are created by graphic designers and uploaded to your web-to-print portal by someone with graphic design skills and tools. Most likely it will be your current design agency or it can be any other graphic designer.</p>
<p>Once the templates are uploaded they can be changed by your staff online. No special tools or skills are required. Anyone can do it.</p>
<h2>Output for print</h2>
<p>Your web-to-print portal will generate output files as part of an order and forward them to your print provider.  You control who, when and how.</p>
<p>Changing a print provider becomes as simple as changing an email address of the recipient.</p>
<h2>Output for internal use</h2>
<p>Staff members can download the output files and use them for their own purpose. It will take them minutes to prepare a marketing brochure that would normally take many hours or day if they had to involve a designer.</p>
<h2>Saving time and money</h2>
<p>The design agency that looks after your graphic designs may not like this online ordering idea. You won&#8217;t be calling them every time you need a change of name on a business card and they can&#8217;t bill you for it any more.</p>
<p>They will need to produce templates, which is no harder or more expensive than producing the design itself. The rest is done online by your staff and your web-to-print portal to save everyone time and money.</p>
