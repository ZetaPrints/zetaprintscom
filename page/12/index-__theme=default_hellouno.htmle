          <h2>Use the Web to Grow Your Printing Business</h2>
<p>The ZetaPrints web-to-print service gives your printing business a quick and easy way to take customer orders online. Everything you (and your customers) need is available online 24/7 through the ZetaPrints website. Or, you can set it up so your customers can access a website bearing <a title="Web-to-print branding" href="../../printers/web-to-print-branding/" target="_self">your company logo and name</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>No need for them (or you) to invest in new hardware or software.</p>
<p>And the good news is that it&#8217;s affordable. In fact, the cost-per-order is probably less than what you&#8217;re paying to process a single order over the phone. No monthly or set-up fees, either. The cost-per-order is <a title="Web-to-print pricing" href="../../printers/web-to-print-pricing-printer/" target="_self">the only fee you pay</a> to use the service.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Web-to-print template customization" src="../../img/w2p-diagr.gif" alt="Web-to-print template customization" /></p>
<h2>More good news:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The system uses the same design files your customers are already using.</li>
<li>You or your designers can upload user <a title="About templates for ZetaPrints" href="../../printers/web-to-print-templates/" target="_self">document templates</a>.</li>
<li>Templates are available as soon as someone uploads them into the system.</li>
<li>A job proof is available online within seconds.</li>
<li>You get instant e-mail notification of new orders.</li>
<li>You can <a title="Web-to-print help: Order status" href="../../help/order-status/" target="_self">track orders</a> online and download print-ready files when ready.</li>
<li>All information about orders, your customers and your company is <a title="Our privacy statement" href="../../footer-menu/privacy-policy/" target="_self">secure</a>.</li>
<li>The system can be used for variable data, short run, and long run printing.</li>
