		<description><![CDATA[Hey, I&#039;ve gotten one of these cards and they&#039;re okay at best.  If you&#039;re spending $100, $200, or more on these cards, wouldn&#039;t it just be easier, cheaper, quicker and more personal to pick up the damn phone and spend a few seconds saying HELLO?  I&#039;m sure it would be more appreciated.  The person who sent me the card lives in my city - but it took the card 1 week to get delivered.  HUH???  I got the card, because he&#039;s convinced this is a money making opportunity for him - a get rich quick kind of thing.  I&#039;m all for getting rich quick, but the whole SOC thing smacks of pyramid scheme and quite frankly, I would have appreciated a phone call more.  If people want to sell SOC stuff and go to their seminars and recruit other people - more power to you.  If you want to get rich quick, buy a lottery ticket.  Your chances of winning are the same chances you have of getting rich off SOC.  Cheers and best of luck to you entrepreneurs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Punkie,
I&#039;m in Australia, maybe that&#039;s different.
Many cards seem to arrive in a week&#039;s time, but definitely not all of them, I posted almost 200 cards, and I don&#039;t want to ask (or expect) everybody to reply to the card.
I did find it odd when some (4) real close friends did not respond, since I go through a lot of effort creating the cards, sure enough, they never received their card.
It sure has put a damper on my enthusiasm about SOC.
I have been selling on Ebay for years and never ever had anything gone missing in the post, so I don&#039;t think the problem lies with Australian Post.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really? That&#039;s odd. All my cards seem to be reaching their local destinations within the week. Up to 14 days overseas. 

It might be a good idea to write in the card something along the lines of &quot;let me know when you&#039;ve received this so I know you have.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I signed up with SOC last year, I really liked the fact that I could create my own cards. The cards are very affordable, BUT.. It takes AGES for the cards to be delivered up to 14 days even if it is to my own neighbor! Also after not receiving replies from my friends I found out that a considerable amount of cards never reached their destination at all. SOC will refund or resend the cards, but how many other cards did not get delivered I don&#039;t know (you don&#039;t want to ring up everybody afterward and ask them if they actually received your card)
Some people who I have send cards 1 month ago are still waiting for their card. BORING....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been using SendOutCards for about a month and I absolutely love it!!! 

I was told about it by my best friend since he bought the wholesale package a couple of months ago. He loved it so much that he encouraged me to sign up. Trust me, this is my best friend of 15 years and there&#039;s no way on earth he&#039;d ever try to rip me off. But really, the product sells itself, it&#039;s not like I was sold on it by him.

I bought the wholesale package on his advice, so if I wanted to, I can sell the system to others and make money ($150 for ach person who buys the wholesale package and a % of the cards they buy and send). BUT, I really don&#039;t have time to do that, so I haven&#039;t bothered with trying to sell it yet. I just bought the wholesale package because that way it&#039;s considered a small business and I get tax write-offs. For only $100 more than the retail package, it was well worth it. 

But besides that, I really love the product! It&#039;s super easy to use, they have tons of options and I don&#039;t have to leave home, buy a card (or a gift) at the store, go to the post office, and mail it. I mean, who has time to do that nowadays? I&#039;m a busy person. But just yesterday, I was able to send my nephew in England a card and a book (from Canada) in less than 5 minutes. To me, that&#039;s amazing!

Also, because it&#039;s so cheap, simple and fast to use, I have been sending out cards left, right and center. I actually believe that it has made me a more thoughtful person. 

So before you call it a scam, do your research. There are many people out there who absolutely love this product and it works for them. Whether you use it simply as a consumer to send out cards to people you love or want to do business with, or make selling this product a business, doesn&#039;t change the fact that it&#039;s a great service. 

My best friend works with a woman who&#039;s been selling this product for some time and she makes about 10K a month just from this. If you want to turn it into a business, it&#039;s possible. I just like the write-offs like I said. 

Anyway, I&#039;m not an employee of this company or anything. Although technically I might be considered one since I bought the wholesale package, lol. But seriously, I love this product. It&#039;s not a scam, there&#039;s no catch. Just a great idea.]]></description>

As a busy professional I think and look to grow rich, but I certainly wouldn&#039;t have had I continued to waste my time in front of a computer looking at cards.  I did find a great company that does this all for me. No I don&#039;t get anything for posting this, I just wanted to let other busy professionals know there is another company out there that will do all of this for you, and not charge so much.  I now use Client Connector, and love it!
