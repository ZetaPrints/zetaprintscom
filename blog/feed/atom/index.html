		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.zetaprints.com/blog/2013/08/02/forward-updates-in-web-to-print-templates-bug/"><![CDATA[<p>Multi-page web-to-print templates can have <a title="Repeating web-to-print fields" href="../../../help/repeating-fields/">text and image fields shared between multiple pages</a>.</p>
<p>The user can change it only on one page where it is encountered for the first time. All the other pages in the same web-to-print template will reuse the previously entered value.</p>
<p>We had a problem with our web-to-print engine updating pages it didn&#8217;t need to update when the shared fields were involved. If an update failed the user had to start over. This problem has now been fixed.</p>
<p>There is still a performance limitation. If a field spans too many pages with a lot of images it may take too long to update them all resulting in a time-out. Please, let us know if you encounter this situation.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.zetaprints.com/blog/2013/07/31/lost-files/"><![CDATA[<p>One of the servers had a fault that went unnoticed for two weeks at the beginning of July. It was not saving files to the permanent storage while still reporting that everything was OK. By the time we realised there was a problem we lost 500 templates and 9000 images uploaded around that time.</p>
<p>We are trying to recover the files from other distributed locations, but many are lost forever.</p>
<h3><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/web-to-print-404.png"><img class=" wp-image-1121 alignnone" alt="web-to-print-404" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/web-to-print-404.png" srcset="http://www.zetaprints.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/web-to-print-404-300x133.png 300w, http://www.zetaprints.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/web-to-print-404.png 496w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /></a></h3>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<p>Templates with no preview files, images with no thumbnails (just the name), orders with no previews.</p>
<h3>What to do</h3>
<p>Please, re-upload the missing files and regenerate orders.</p>
<h3>Apology</h3>
<p>Everything fails at some stage, but its is completely unacceptable that the file loss went for so long. We added more checks to the code for the future and the sysadmin responsible for the monitoring volunteered to spend a weekend working for a local Fair Trade shop.</p>
<p>Sorry, our bad <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

It can slow down the checkout and make it appear frozen. Users don&#8217;t like to wait and give up before completing the order. We added an optional feature to speed up the checkout process for slow templates.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/output-Files-options1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1115" alt="output-Files-options" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/output-Files-options1.png" width="487" height="254" srcset="http://www.zetaprints.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/output-Files-options1-300x156.png 300w, http://www.zetaprints.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/output-Files-options1.png 487w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /></a></p>
<p>Check on &#8220;delayed file generation&#8221; option (highlighted green) to skip the file generation step at the checkout. It will significantly reduce the time it takes to complete the order.</p>
<p>No files will be generated immediately, but as a printer, you will need to press &#8220;generate files&#8221; link on the order details before downloading them.</p>
<p>This option applies to orders placed directly in your zetaprints portal or in Magento via the API.</p>
<p>Delayed file generation is set per template, but you can use <a title="Bulk-editing web-to-print templates" href="../../../help/bulk-editing-templates/">bulk editing</a> to set this option per catalog.</p>
