				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/courier.jpg" alt="Courier Typeface" style="float:left;" hspace="8" vspace="8" />In text type, it&#8217;s important to realize that there is only one space after a period. The two-space habit after a period can be tough for many typists to break; however, those two spaces can tell some people a lot about your inexperience and your age. Plus, those double spaces often create more work for others, unless you are creating documents in <a href="http://www.lowing.org/fonts/" title="Read more">mono-spaced fonts</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for the double space is that in <a href="http://www.monotypeimaging.com/ProductsServices/monospaced.aspx" title="See some fonts">typewriter fonts</a> (or mono-spaced fonts like the one shown), all of the characters are alloted the same width of space, whether it&#8217;s an &#8220;m,&#8221; an &#8220;i,&#8221; or a period. The two paces after a period calls attention to the punctuation mark at the end of each sentence and creates a visual pause that is needed. In digital typesetting, however, the fonts are variably spaced, meaning each letter is encoded with its own space that is different based upon the width of the character. The punctuation is designed to be slightly larger so that it is easily recognizable at small point sizes without that double space. Therefore, one space after a period has been the standard in typeset copy for some time. Stop using double spaces, as you create more work for your editor or graphic designer when they have to go in and remove those extra spaces.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/tower.jpg' alt='Trajanâ€™s Column' style="float:right;" height="250" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="195" />The font that you see in many books and in just as many Web sites has a long and interesting history. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Roman" title="Read more at Wikipedia">Times Roman</a> comes from the Roman alphabet, which was derived from the Greek alphabet via the ancient Etruscans who settled just above Rome. During Roman military encroachment and empire expansion, this alphabet was adopted and spread from England to the north, to Spain in the west, to Egypt in the south, and to the Persian Gulf in the east by the year 100 CE, when the Roman empire was at its height.</p>
<p>The reason why this typeface spread and was adopted was because the Romans used a single language (Latin), one writing style and a consistent government for centuries. A preeminent example of the beauty of structure and weight of the Roman capital letters is seen in the inscription at the base of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan's_Column" title="Read more at Wikipedia">Trajan&#8217;s column</a> in Rome carved in 114 CE (shown here). This inscription is regarded as the finest example of quality chisel-cut lettering and shows the introduction of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif" title="Read more at Wikipedia">serifs</a>.</p>
