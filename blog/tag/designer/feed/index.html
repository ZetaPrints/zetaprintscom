				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From now on, administering orders in your web-to-print system can be done by designers.</p>
<p>Previously it could only be done by the master account. We expanded the role of designer to cover what production does.</p>
<p>A designer can see orders only for web-to-print catalogs he was granted access to.</p>
<p>Designers can browse, search web-to-print orders, view order details, change order status.</p>
<p>They cannot wave or manage payments. This is a grey area at the moment. We have conflicting requirements. Please, email <a title="Contact ZetaPrints" href="mailto:support@zetaprints.com" target="_self">support@zetaprints.com</a> if you want them to manage payments as well.</p>
<p>Designers cannot empty deleted folder or view user details beyond what is showing in the order details. Nor can they manage users.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Access for print production</h2>
<p>We are making a change to let web-to-print designers access orders, including changing web-to-print order status.</p>
<p>A designer with access to a web-to-print catalog on your web-to-print site will be able to see and manage orders for that catalog. It will be kind of a shared designer/production role.</p>
<p>Please, check your catalogs and remove designers if you do not want them to see your orders. You may want to create some test catalogs for them specifically and then copy them into production, if you don&#8217;t want them to see orders, but still want to work with templates.</p>
<p>This change will come into effect in the next few days.</p>
<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<p>We had a problem with repeating images for some time, but it&#8217;s no more. You can design web-to-print templates and re-use the same image (for effects?) as many times on the same page as you need. Just watch the file size.</p>
<p>A whole bunch of other bugs was fixed. If you know of any bugs we missed, please, let us know.</p>
<h2>New web-to-print features</h2>
<p>We added a few new neat tricks you can do with text fields. Check out this <a title="web-to-print text" href="../../../../help/text-fields-naming-overview/">overview post</a>.</p>
<h2>Web-to-print widget</h2>
<p>We are updating out Flash widget. Some new features there and we removed ZETAPRINTS from the screen as it was a little bit too much self-promo. It has a neutral welcome screen now, if any.</p>
<p>You can see the widget and embedding code if you enable it for a catalog or enable sharing for a template. The widget can show as an embeddable plugin on a page or take the full screen. Give it a try. Make a few viral designs, spread the word and see if it brings you more traffic.</p>
<p>One of the key factors in YouTube success was embedding. Their rivals did not allow that. You know which strategy won in the end.</p>
