				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We noticed a few customers running our Magento <a title="Magento web-to-print" href="../../../../magento/index.html">web-to-print extension</a> didn&#8217;t configure their payment rules correctly and are open for a bit of a rip off.</p>
<p>Namely, if you set your billing rules in Magento to <em>credit card only</em> for certain countries and not the others, then those others have an option of paying by <em>money order</em>. It means they have a free run if you allow file downloading.</p>
<p>By the way, did you look at our <a title="Magento and web-to-print" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/web-to-print-and-dynamic-imaging.html">latest stable release?</a></p>
<p>Several <a title="Magento web-to-print release notes" href="http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/wiki/ReleaseNotes">improvements</a> in there and more in the works. <a title="Magento web-to-print project" href="http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/issues/list?can=2&q=stream=Approval">Order approval</a> is one of them. Let us know about your desired approval process. We try to make the process as generic as possible, but yours may have some interesting twists we need to know about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We released <a title="web-to-print, stable" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/web-to-print-and-dynamic-imaging.html">a stable version of web&#8211;to-print extension for Magento 1.4</a>. Lots of new web-to-print features.</p>
<h2>New web-to-print features</h2>
<p>It is fully compatible with the new Magento release and has a log of new features. Image editing is one of them. Images cannot be moved yet, but they can be cropped and rotated right on the previews page. You can<a title="web-to-print demo" href="../../../../magento/index.php/realestate-signs/remax-signs/remax-horizontal-sign-01-2-photos-24-x-18.html"> try it live</a> on our <a title="web-to-print demo" href="../../../../magento/index.html">demo Magento web-to-print site</a>.</p>
<h2>Web-to-print in your language</h2>
<p>Magento itself can be run in many languages. All popular ones have already been translated to. Our <a title="web-to-print translations" href="../../../../help/magento-web-to-print-localization/index.html">web-to-print extension can be translated</a> as well. You can run it in German, French, you name. There are lots of translation packages ready to be downloaded and installed. Translate the web-to-print part and it will be all in your language.</p>
<h2>Web-to-print extension is ahead of ZP</h2>
<p>In some respect, our Magento extension is more advanced than the standard ZetaPrints web-to-print interface. It is definitely better suited for applications where the visual part of the interface is more important than its simplicity.</p>
<h2>Do you want to migrate?</h2>
<p>Anyone looking at customization of your web-to-print portal should seriously look into our Magento web-to-print extension. We can definitely help you with setting up a Magento web-to-print site and migrating your ZP data there. Let us know if you are interested.</p>

<p>Magento Community edition (the free one) has no access control. It&#8217;s a feature of their Enterprise edition, which costs money. We created a simple extension that allows access control at a basic level, but it should do the job for small portals. Please, <a title="access control for web-to-print" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/category-access-control.html">give it a try</a>.</p>
<h2>Web-to-print extension update</h2>
<p>We also released a stable update for our <a title="web-to-print for magento" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/web-to-print-and-dynamic-imaging.html">web-to-print extension</a> for Magento. It went through a dozen of betas and has many bugs fixed, plus many new features. It&#8217;s really shaping up now. Image uploading and basic editing features are in the works. We planned to release them couple of weeks ago, but the festive season got on the way.</p>
<p>You need to update the XML in data import and product creation profiles for the latest upgrade to work correctly. See the latest <a title="magento web-to-print help" href="../../../../help/import-web-to-print-data/index.html">help for web-to-print extension</a>.</p>
<h2>Problems with emails</h2>
<p>We are having problems with many emails not being delivered. It is a complex issue with some of it beyond our control. We are trying to find altenatives, but it may take another 24 hrs.</p>
<p>Would you like notifications about new web-to-print orders to arrive as text messages to your cellphone via Twitter? Flick us an email and we&#8217;ll set you up.</p>
