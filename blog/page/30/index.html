It changed in 21/01/07 release to a message that the request will be followed up. At the same time the system dispatches an email to the printer with details of the user that tried to register.</p>
<p>The change may result in a slightly increased volume of email traffic for the printer, but the positive side is that the traffic should result in acquiring and signing up new customers.</p>

    <p>Zetaprints customers can now sell printing to the general public through Zetaprints web-to-print interface. It was a long awaited feature that took quite a bit of effort for the development stuff.</p>
<h2>Three access categories</h2>
<p><strong>Corporate access</strong> – nothing changed there. You can still specify a corporate domain name or add users manually.</p>
<p><strong>Self-registration</strong> – minor improvements to the registration process. You can publish a URL for self-registration for a particular catalogue and anyone can register with any email address. It may be a good option if you print for franchises or some community where there is no drama with some outsiders getting hold of designs or placing an odd order through.</p>
<p><strong>Public access</strong> – all new. Catalogues marked for public access will show on the home page. No login, no registration is required to place an order. Anonymous users can register at any time or log in.</p>
<h2>Limitations for unregistered users</h2>
<p>1. File transfer is not available<br />
2. Image library management is not available, but all images are cached anyway<br />
3. Access to orders may be difficult if they try to access them from another computer later, but they can always bookmark the page or register to avoid the difficulties<br />
4. No order copies are sent to an unregistered user until the email address is confirmed</p>
<h2>What difference it all makes</h2>
<p>As a printer, you can now offer a range of printed products to the general public. This may not be as lucrative as serving the corporate market, but still gives you additional room to grow your business.</p>
<p>The other spin-off from this feature is addition of generic product ranges to your corporate catalogues with a minimal effort. For example, you may need only one set of greeting cards set to public access to make it available to all your corporate customers as well as the general public.</p>

    <p>Font uploading was limited to TTF fonts (.ttf) or OpenType fonts with True Type outlines only (.oft). This led to some OTF files being rejected by the server. This has been changed to allow use of Open Type Fonts with Post Script outlines.</p>
<p>More font type options are coming soon.</p>

    <p>In September of 1985, Malaysia unveiled its first locally produced car named Proton Saga. It was the culmination of years of careful planning and marked the beginning of Malaysia’s automotive industry. The first car was not much to scream about, though there was a lot of national pride surrounding it, especially during the first year. It received a lot of media coverage, and was the topic of discussion for the general public. Everything about it was scrutinized, including the logo.</p>
<h2>The Original Proton Logo</h2>
<p><a href="http://web-to-print.zetaprints.com/?attachment_id=95" rel="attachment wp-att-95" title="Proton Old Logo"></a><a href="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/proton-old-logo.jpg" title="Proton Old Logo"><img src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/proton-old-logo.jpg" alt="Proton Old Logo" style="margin-right:10px;" align="left" /></a>This logo was the original logo used by PROTON (Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional). At the base of the logo is a crescent moon and atop it, prominently displayed in the centre is a fourteen pointed star. The background is blue in colour, while both the crescent moon and the fourteen pointed star is yellow. While this logo has a symbolic meaning that is obvious at the first glance to Malaysians, most foreigners will not be able to understand it at all. Why? Because the logo is based on the Malaysian flag.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/malaysian-flag.jpg" title="Malaysian Flag"><img src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/malaysian-flag.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Malaysian Flag" align="right" /></a>The Malaysian flag, as you can see, has a similar crescent moon and the fourteen pointed star in a blue carton in the top left hand corner of the flag. The crescent moon represents the national religion, which is Islam, and the fourteen pointed star stands for the 13 states and the federation of Malaysia. The dark blue colour represents the unity of the people, while yellow is the royal colour of the Malay Rulers.</p>
<p>It is obvious then, that the PROTON logo is inspired by the Malaysian flag. And this comes as no surprise, for the nation used the car company as a way to instill national pride. Thus choosing a logo that represents the nation made perfect sense.</p>
<h2>The Present PROTON logo</h2>
<p><a href="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/proton-present-logo.jpg" title="Present PROTON logo"><img src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/proton-present-logo.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Present PROTON logo" align="left" /></a>In the mid 90s, PROTON revamped its line of car models and underwent an image change. The models covered a wider range and boasted of more accessories and knick knacks. In a glitzy event, the public was introduced to the new range of cars, along with the new PROTON logo.<br />
The new logo boasts of a stylized tiger head, with the words PROTON emblazoned boldly on top of it. The blue colour background is retained, but the yellow takes on a golden hue. To my knowledge, PROTON has not released an official explanation of this new logo but I think we can venture a guess. The tiger is an animal found in Malaysian jungles, and is also used in logos and crests in Malaysia, thus it is a suitable choice for a Malaysian logo.</p>
<p>The reasons behind the changes can be figured out. Firstly, the old logo was not easily understood by the export market. People could not identify with it, for it required knowledge of Malaysian history, or at least the flag to appreciate the symbolism. The use of the crescent moon itself became a weakness, as it is viewed as a religious symbol. The new logo is free of such national or religious symbolism, allowing it to be accepted by a wider audience. The use of animal motif follows other car companies such as Ferrari with their prancing pony, and of course, Jaguar, with their leaping jaguar.</p>
<p>It is clear that PROTON took pains to ensure that its logo would be easily recognizable, accepted and remembered when it changed it. The importance of a logo should not be underestimated, for it is first thing, and for some people, the only thing they remember about a product. PROTON has realized that and has repositioned itself to better compete in a global market. That realization can be seen through the change of its logo.</p>
<p>What do I think of this personally? Well, nationalism and pride is all well and good, but if we’re going to compete and survive in a competitive industry, we’ve got to play by the rules of the game. Besides, I think the present logo is more appealing overall. So a job well done to PROTON for changing with the times.</p>

    <p>I read an <a href="http://www.gammag.com/BackIssues/artbgam0609.salescall">article by Bill Farquharson</a> published in Graphics Arts Monthly as editorial back in September 2006. It’s called “Please, Get Out of Printing!”.</p>
<p>To cut the long story short, a printer submitted a proposal to an RFQ and the response from the customer was:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Thanks, but your price is no better than the price from our existing printer and we don&#8217;t see any reason to change. . . .&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Then the boss of the printing company met with the client and cut the price to an unsustainable level. Then the author went on and on winging how stupid it was and that printers should add value and help customers solve real problems, etc, etc, etc. Nice old fashioned stuff. Not going to judge them here.</p>
<h2>From the other side of the fence</h2>
<p>I spent a few hrs today with a large print buyer who tried to change their printer and find someone cheaper and easier to handle. Not disclosing any names here, but we ran into a wall of misunderstanding.</p>
<p>First we went surfing the web and look at the local sites. The websites were just shocking. A handful of ugly-looking pages or meaningless flash intros promising the same high quality printing, added value and a quote request via a web form. How can one choose? They all look the same. They have more or less the same prices and a varying quality of printing, that varies from job to job even for the same printer anyway.</p>
<p>We quickly ran out of the sites to look at and went into Yellow Pages. It was getting really boring and I left.</p>
<p>What was the buyer looking for?<br />
&#8211; a one stop shop for marketing materials with a mix of digital, offset and some choice of finishing options<br />
&#8211; reliable and repeatable quality<br />
&#8211; quick quoting and up-front pricing<br />
&#8211; quick and easy job submission</p>
<p>Ideally, all the transactions would happen online, unless they need some suggestions from the printer on the best way of handling an unusual project, which doesn’t happen very often.</p>
<h2>Are you any different?</h2>
<p>Bill Farquharson, in the aforementioned article in GAM suggested that that printer should become a car salesman if the best he can do is to cut the price. Fair enough.</p>
<p>So, now ask yourself some question&#8230;<br />
How different are you from your customer’s point of view?<br />
Do you stand out of the crowd?</p>
<p>&#8230; and don’t answer YES only because you have a better press than your immediate competitor because no one cares.</p>
<p>The printing industry is very much a level playing field. The difference between players of the same class is negligible to the average consumer. Technolgy-ignorant printers will be reduced to undercutting their own prices and going out of business if they don’t offer their customers good business connectivity in the literal sense – via the Internet.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you have another trick up your sleeve or your printing technology is so superior that you are in your own class?</p>
<p>P.S. Don’t buy Bill Farquharson&#8217;s new training DVD available at www.printtec.com or 800.587.7022. because he won’t teach you about the customer servicing technology or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_to_Print">web-to-print</a>. Please, prove me wrong here.</p>

    <h2>A Little Bit of Myself.</h2>
<p>I’m Mike Tan, I’m a Malaysian Chinese. Malaysia is a little country in south east Asia. We’re north of Singapore and south of Thailand. I myself live in a little island called Penang, dubbed as the Pearl of the Orient by travelers almost a century ago. I’m a creative editor, a job that mixes creative ideas with design processes, and I have been in involved in graphics, design and printing for the past 5 years.</p>
<h2>Malaysian design in a word.</h2>
<p><a href="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/rojak-1.JPG" title="Rojak"><img align="left" src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/rojak-1.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Rojak" style="margin-right:10px;" /></a>If I was asked to describe Malaysian design in a word, I’d choose the word ROJAK. A malay term, rojak literally means mix or potpourri. It also happens to be a name of a fruit dish here in Malaysia. Think of it as a fruit salad, with a spicy kick and you’d come to as close a description as you can get for rojak.</p>
<p>So why rojak? Because Malaysian design usually incorporates a fusion of colours. At times it results in a garish clash of colours, each screaming for attention, while at other times, the colours merge and swirl, each complementing the other, forming such a colourful harmony.<br />
<em>Pic: Rojak, a mixed fruit salad, brings to mind the concept of fusion in Malaysian design. Mind the spicy kick though.</em></p>
<h2>Batik: An example of unique design.</h2>
<p><a href="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/batik-design-process.jpg" title="Batik Design Process"><img align="left" src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/batik-design-process.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Batik Design Process" style="margin-right:10px;" /></a> Process of making batik.</p>
<p>Batik is a traditional art form used in creating vibrant and stunning cloth designs utilizing waxing and dyeing techniques. Traditionally batik designs are hand drawn and dyed, making each item unique. The colours used in batik range the whole spectrum, and often appears in hues as well.</p>
<p>The designs on the cloth vary, featuring a mix of floral motifs, with intertwining flowers and petals, geometric motifs, arranged in interesting and delightful ways, and animal motifs, both real and mythological. Colour schemes include contrasting, complementary, and a mixture of hues.</p>
<p><img src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/mixed-design-batik.jpg" alt="Batik Picture 1" style="margin-right:15px;" /><img src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/mythological-design-batik.jpg" alt="Batik Picture 2" style="margin-right:15px;" /><img src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/rooster-design-batik.jpg" alt="Batik Picture 3" style="margin-right:15px;" /></p>
<p>Some examples of batik designs. Mixtures of floral and geometric designs, mythological creatures, and domestic animals.</p>
<h2>Malaysian Design: A fusion of colours</h2>
<p>Design usually is influenced by culture and history, and in this sense, Malaysian design is no exception. It has a rich past, being situated in the between the trade route to China. Through the centuries, it has been influenced by many cultures, both western, such as Portuguese, Dutch, English, as well as eastern, such as Chinese, Siamese, and Indian. Aspects of these cultures were assimilated into Malaysian culture, and thus design as well. Thus the analogy of rojak in the earlier section. Each culture is distinctly unique, yet a part of the whole.</p>
<p>Religion also is one of the factors that influences design. In Europe, many great works of art were inspired by religion. We only have to look at the grandeur of the Vatican City, with the Sistine Chapel if we need an example. Religious influence in Malaysian design can be very obvious at times, in the case of mythological creatures as motifs, and also very subtle as well, for instance in the use of geometrical shapes, which was pioneered by the Muslims. Malaysian designs also draw heavily from nature, with large tropical flower designs, weaving creepers that often form geometrical or symmetrical shapes.</p>
<p>Taking all this into consideration, it comes as no surprise that Malaysian designs tend to be vibrant and colourful, even to the point of being garish at times. It reflects the spirit and soul of a nation that has adapted and assimilated various cultures and religions through the centuries, embracing that which is different, yet all the while, trying to remain the same.</p>

    <p>Does printing industry follow the path of food supply industry?<br />
It may well be the case and there are a few lessons to learn for those who realised it early enough.</p>
<h2>Food supply industry example</h2>
<p>Let’s go some 150 years back and look at the history of food supply.</p>
<p>First there were food markets. Farmers took produce to the market and sold it themselves. They kept all the profits and did all the work.</p>
<p>Then there came grocery shops, then larger shops and the farms were getting larger. Then there were even larger shops and supply chains until we all ended up with supermarkets and huge supply chains like Wal-Mart, Tesco, ASDA, etc. They drive prices down, compete for the market share and dictate their conditions to their suppliers. It may not look fair, but the consumer is usually the one to benefit from the cheaper prices.</p>
<p>Look at our little NZ produce market. There are 2 major chains: Foodstuffs (43%) and Progressive Enterprises (57%) that reported earning of $132 million before tax for 8 months in 2006. One may say that it is $132 million squeezed out of the suppliers.</p>
<p>Both chains constantly drive the suppliers’ prices down. The consumer benefits as long as there is competition between chains. When one of them gets significantly bigger than the other the competition ends and it all takes a completely different direction.</p>
<h2>From food to printing</h2>
<p>Looking at where printing is I can say that it’s somewhere comparable to what food supply industry was at the times of grocery stores and a vivid Saturday market.</p>
<p>There are print brokers and there are individual printing businesses selling direct to the customer. This may be no more. The emergence of large print buying groups is changing the whole picture and looks painfully familiar (see the food supply example).</p>
<h2>Their weapons</h2>
<p>Their weapons are technology and sales people. They are resourceful, they can afford it.<br />
A one-stop-shop offer is hard to resist for businesses because of all the convenience and savings it brings to them. The main beneficiary is the consumer. The main loose is the printer. The man in the middle pockets the money.</p>
<p>The development path of a print buying group usually begins with large corporates and progresses to smaller and smaller businesses. <a href="http://www.stream.net.au/">Stream Solutions</a> from Australia is just such example. They are a relatively young company with a very high growth.</p>
<h2>Their strength</h2>
<p>Stream Solutions are not only about driving the prices down and wedging between the printer and the customer. They are mainly about bringing in so much overlooked efficiency in the process with all the savings involved and passed onto the consumer.  The other benefit is brining designers into the process in way that makes it even more efficient for the customers.</p>
<h2>Why they won’t be beaten and the printer will loose</h2>
<p>Well, not all printers will loose of cause, but the majority will. The reasons are plenty, but <strong>there is one word to describe them all: IGNORANCE</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Too many printers seem to think that customers enjoy dealing with them</strong>. No, all customers want is to get the job done. The less time and effort they need to invest in it the better.</p>
<p><strong>Too many printers believe that a printing project begins and ends within their premises</strong>. No. A printing project begins at the customer’s office and ends when the items are delivered to the final recipient. A lot of printers just don’t get the big picture.</p>
<p><strong>Too many printers are too absorbed in their printing technology</strong> completely ignoring the technology that services the customer. Who wants to know that they have a 6 colour-press with the latest cutting and folding add-on and the super-duper ink? The absolute majority of customers are not interested in the process. What important is cost, quality and features of the final product, turnaround and the effort customers need to put in it to have things done.</p>
<h2>No time for complacency</h2>
<p>The pressure on printers is mounting from all directions, but you may not be noticing yet. The change is not going to happen overnight, but it’s happening right there, right now, right before our eyes. Printers that do not change their ways and do not stop being ignorant about the big picture and the technology to service customers going to be squeezed our by those that do.</p>
<h2>On a lighter note &#8230;</h2>
<p>Did you know that fire drills and false alarms are sponsored by the local café owners?<br />
Why?<br />
Where do you go with your mates during the drill?</p>
<p>There is another theory now &#8230;</p>

              <div class="entry">
    <p>This blog is about to publish a series of articles from Asian designers on the state of graphic design and printing in their countries. I saw two draft articles from our Malaysian contributor and am eager to see the final versions here.</p>
<p>We live in an increasingly shrinking world where everything is just a few clicks away, but we miss out on a lot of information from non-English speaking countries. I’m excited to learn about the Asian design and printing industries and their specifics.</p>
<p>Why would you care? Probably there are two main reasons:<br />
1. You may start noticing and using Asian resources for the benefit of your business.<br />
2. You may want to know why some of your competitors and customers are already using them. (they would be your former customers then, probably)</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>

              <div class="entry">
    <p class="style25" align="justify"><strong><font face="georgia">FONT AND COLOR AS THE  BASIC ELEMENTS OF DESIGN</font></strong></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia">Font is an indispensable element of design. For what is a web page without text? What is a greeting card without words? Even sites intended to showcase nothing but pictures would have to have words for description and as such, the proper selection of fonts is essential. And your greeting card, no matter how graphic, needs to have words, like that line which tells who you are sending it to.</font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia">Color plays an equally vital role. Even if you don’t have graphics, you will be using color. Even the so-called gray scale, monochrome or black-and-white technically use contrasting colors, namely different shades of gray or black and white. And so when you have a visual message to present, font and color are the two basic components you just can’t do without.</font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia"> </font></p>
<p class="style25" align="justify"><strong><font face="georgia">GOING BEYOND BASIC</font></strong></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia">There is a third design component and this one is so fascinating that most designers quickly jump in and use it without giving much regard on how it should be properly used. This component is <strong>texture</strong> and it is the one design tool that will take your project beyond the ordinary &#8211; either that or it will completely ruin your work. The good designer knows it takes courage to work with textures because it is not easy to find (or create) a good set that harmoniously combines font, color, and texture with the overall concept of the project. This being a fact, when things don’t look good and harmony just doesn’t seem to come in, the element to be dropped is texture. On the other hand, when successfully used, texture can make your message speak in a more meaningful and more appealing manner. That awesome work of art that is perceived by the eye touches the soul in a very gripping way.</font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia"><a href="http://web-to-print.zetaprints.com/?attachment_id=67" rel="attachment wp-att-67" title="tx1.jpg"><img src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/tx1.jpg" alt="tx1.jpg" /></a></font></p>
<p class="style25" align="justify"><strong><font face="georgia">SPEAKING TO THE SENSES</font></strong></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia">When you are working on a web page (or card art), you have to be very careful with using texture. Otherwise, use it sparingly. There are lots of web pages out there that distastefully use texture. For instance, using a marble backdrop monotonously for an entire page is not at all pretty. It makes the reader feel like he’s in a marble-walled house – cold and not pleasing to be in. Having said that, we now come to the interesting observation of how texture affects feelings. Texture has the ability to impart a tactile feel of jaggedness or smoothness (although you don’t actually touch the image); it allows a perception of shade or glare; it is capable of emitting warmth or cold; and most interestingly, texture provokes emotions such as joy, melancholy, excitement, and even love.</font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia"><a href="http://web-to-print.zetaprints.com/?attachment_id=69" rel="attachment wp-att-69" title="tx2.jpg"><img src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/tx2.jpg" alt="tx2.jpg" /></a></font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia"> </font></p>
<p class="style25" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style25" align="justify"><strong><font face="georgia">GOOD PRACTICE</font></strong></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia">Going back to the issue of the monotonous marble backdrop, I would suggest toning down the use of textures to banners, side columns, and other small areas such as thin frames or dividers. Make sure your textures go harmoniously with your page’s overall theme. If you have several textures you want to use together, see first if they complement each other. As a general rule, use textures sparingly. Saturation can kill your design.</font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia">The creative use of texture creates a dividing line between the programmer and the designer. A programmer merely “assembles” without giving much concern as to whether or not his bits and pieces go along amicably. He is content that his work has texture and believes that his pages have now been rescued from being plain and boring.</font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia"><a href="http://web-to-print.zetaprints.com/?attachment_id=70" rel="attachment wp-att-70" title="tx3.jpg"><img src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/tx3.jpg" alt="tx3.jpg" /></a></font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia">The designer, on the other hand, carefully plans and does a lot of test-running. He has a keen eye for beauty. He is an artist. He carefully chooses his textures and makes sure they are used without compromising elegance and simplicity. Being a good designer, he uses texture to enhance the not only the overall look of his pages, but more importantly to give better emphasis to what his work is all about.</font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia"> </font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><strong><font face="georgia">MAKING YOUR OWN TEXTURES</font></strong></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia"><a href="http://web-to-print.zetaprints.com/?attachment_id=71" rel="attachment wp-att-71" title="tx4.jpg"><img src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/tx4.jpg" alt="tx4.jpg" /></a></font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia">Many sites offer free ready-made textures, often in the form of tiles. Sometimes, we come across sites with protected content, but their graphics are so pretty we may be tempted to steal or “borrow” them. If you have graphic assembly/editing software such as JASC Paintshop, CorelDraw or Adobe Photoshop, you can easily make your own textures. For starters, try creating a 2”x2” square with a solid color. Simply add effects such as those from Photoshop’s “filter” menu. Add one effect after another and viola! You have your very own all-original texture tile. Experiment with your software and you’ll see how fun it is to create your own textures. Try out some simple crayon effects and pretty soon you’ll be making those fancy textures with the shimmering feel, or even those space-age tiles with lights playing and making it sort of look like a nebula.</font></p>

<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia"> </font></p>
<p class="style25" align="justify"><strong><font face="georgia">TO THE ADVOCATORS OF  MINIMALISM</font></strong></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia">Architect <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe">Ludwig  Mies van der Rohe</a></u> adopted the motto &#8220;<u><a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Robert_Browning"><em>Less  is more</em></a></u>&#8220;. The phrase, although originally meant for the architect’s home-building tactics, has become very popular among modern designers. But sometimes it is being made into a lame excuse for not coming up with something new and adventurous. There is no room for extra features such as textures in the strict minimalist concept of design. I personally think it is not practical to adhere to this principle. Why limit yourself to flat and plain geometry when you create something that can better flaunt the great artist in you?</font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia"> <a href="http://web-to-print.zetaprints.com/?attachment_id=72" rel="attachment wp-att-72" title="tx5.jpg"><img src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/tx5.jpg" alt="tx5.jpg" /></a></font></p>
<p class="style25" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style25" align="justify"><strong><font face="georgia">ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES</font></strong></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia">The use of textures is a good way to step out of the ordinary. It provokes the artist in you and gets you into feeling for yourself what you are trying to express. And of course, you become a better designer because you have a good and effective way of staging your ideas.</font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia">Experiment with textures  and discover boundless potentials. The only limit will be your  imagination.</font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia"> </font></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><strong><font face="georgia">SOMETHING FOR YOUR DAD</font></strong></p>
<p class="style24" align="justify"><font face="georgia">To finish off this article, here&#8217;s a poem which I made for my Daddy some time ago. I framed it in some textures and added a couple of images which I got from<a href="http://www.moonandbackgraphics.com/" class="style26"> Moon and Back Graphics,</a> which, by the way, was my very first source of fascination and inspiration for creating digital art. Here&#8217;s the card, you can print it out and give it to your daddy.</font></p>
<p class="style4" align="justify"><font face="georgia">Have fun with textures!</font></p>
