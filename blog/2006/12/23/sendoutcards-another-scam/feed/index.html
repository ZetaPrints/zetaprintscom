		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m noticing that either disgruntled people are flat out lying about SOC ($2-$3 a card, yea right) or they are people who need quite a bit of help with their computer. And it really doesn&#039;t help anyone to talk about a product or business opportunity that very little is known about. Let&#039;s just keep the info. accurate and stop all the hate. Sendoutcards is an amazing company and product. I&#039;m so thankful it came into my life. Now go have good thoughts and keep it real.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good reply by Brenda Silverman. I am an avid user of Sendoutcards.com and find it very convenient to send real, good quality cards, postcards, gift cards, gifts. A card has never cost me more than $2 after adding a couple of pictures to it. All of my recipients have nothing but positive comments about what they receive. I also like the fact that I can now create my own postcard or card by simply uploading a jpg file and using it as the front of the card. Those cost another $0.75 but still much less than a card from the store that is not customized EXACTLY how I want it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am stunned at some of the negativity regarding SOC. I bought a Wholesale system for my husband to help him stay in touch with his customers (he is a food manufacturing rep) in a more personal way and his results have been nothing short of AMAZING! Anyone who invests in SendOutCards and does not take some time to learn how to use it has no real right to complain in my opinion! Also, the most we have ever paid to send a card was 0.93 cents NOT $2-$3! Also #3, The refund policy is CLEAR as a bell! The bottom line is that SendOutCards is the BEST value on the market and a great product for building better business and personal relationships!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been a member for almost a year. For the promise of cheaper cards, I deposited a large sum ($300 plus dollars. Over $500 to date since they hit my card for $16. each month) to do a campaign.  I never sent out a campaign due to the complexity of accomplishing what I want. The severely limited number of cards that I actually liked is another problem.

So far, I have sent out exactly 17 cards.

The cards can be expensive ($2-3 after you add all the points to send a card you actually would want to send and pay postage which they deceptively try to sublty hint that is included in the card).   It is not convenient, nor technologically advanced. They don&#039;t teach you that once you deposit money in &quot;your&quot; account, you will never see the money again. (after 3 days)

It would be different if they acutally gave you the money back if you didn&#039;t use to purchase their cards, but that is not the case.  They did not inform me of their refund policy.  They refused my two requests for refunds.  I currently have complaints on file with the Utah Attorney General, the FTC, The BBB and soon the DSA and The DMA.

I have to believe that a class action suit is on the way since there have to be many others like me that didn&#039;t send cards, decided not to try to figure it out and wanted their money back.  This company will go down.  Taking money and not delivering a product and refusing to disclose these unfair  practices?  You decide.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s hilarious how SOC people come on here to defend their &quot;business&quot;. You make more money by getting more people to work under you than if you had people &quot;buying&quot; cards under you. I&#039;ve tried it and felt like crap. I had to quit after 8 months of this company. I made money, but it was off of conning people into joining. You can make money w/ SOC, but you have to have no soul or morals.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; A lot of referral sites promise a FREE card. The links
&#062; always go some dodgy sites or emails @aol.com
&#062; None of the links took me to any ordering page. The
&#062; farthest I got was a thank you screen after filling in a
&#062; contact request form. Tough luck. Neither you can send
&#062; anything directly thru SendOutCards. Go try it. I’m keen
&#062; to hear from anyone who succeeds.

Update:

SOC now has a fully automated process for you to send the free card.

Whereas before you needed someone to walk you through the SOC service, now a video on the side does it.

You can set up an account and send a free card from the link below, and I await the feedback on this forum.

Enjoy,

P.S. Since this is costs ME actual money each time someone uses this, I reserve the right to close this off at any time after this post has been up for two weeks to let &#039;Scam Buster&#039; give it a go. I found this post on Google, and so could anyone else.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry you were unable to send a postcard from your desktop. You need to get an account to use SendOutCards. The &quot;free&quot; bit is when someone gives you a gift account to give the system a go. They are real cards, with a real stamp and so they cost real money (but unlike most network marketing companies it&#039;s cheaper than buying it in a store.) I help small businesses with marketing, and I think there is value in using the cards for that.
I&#039;m in Australia, and I&#039;m sending cards to people in the US for less than the cost of the stamps from Australia to the US alone!
I presume you&#039;re in the US, but if you&#039;re outside the US then email me.

P.S. With your trouble hunting down what SendOutCards is about it&#039;s more like dodgy web layout, than dodgy enterprise. If it&#039;s any consolation, SOC&#039;s front page is clearer than it used to be :-)]]></description>
