		<description><![CDATA[I am shocked and upset by your note to ETG Customers.  This is more a reflection on you than on ETG.  It doesn&#039;t matter how good your company is, it is extremely unprofessional of you to post such a comment and if I could click on a &#039;dislike intensely&#039; button I would.  My businesses have greatly valued the support we have received from ETG over the years.  They have been a stunning example of a values-based business.  Yes, they are going through a hard patch right now, band don&#039;t deserve to be kicked like this and in such a public way.  I urge you to withdraw such a disappointing and self-serving announcement immediately.  Sincerely, Tekla Kridle, Owner/Manager Harcourts Beckenham / Barrington / Harbourside]]></description>
