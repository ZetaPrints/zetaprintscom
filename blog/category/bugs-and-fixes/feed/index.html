				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our <a title="web-to-print software" href="../../../../magento-web-to-print/">Magento web-to-print extension</a> versions prior to 2.0.1.0beta5 generate output pdf/jpg files and bill for the order regardless of the payment result in Magento. It led to some of our customers facing bills much more than they expected. E.g., an order was placed, files generated, no payment from the customer, but it was still billed for at ZP end.<span id="more-1022"></span></p>
<h3>Solution 1: Express checkout</h3>
<p>Web-to-print sites with credit card payments via PayPal can switch to <a title="About PayPal express" href="https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/e_howto_api_ECGettingStarted">PayPal Express</a> option. There will be no orders generated in Magento unless the customer pays. The disadvantage is that you may want to accept the order and chase the customer for the payment or offer an alternative method. So it&#8217;s better to get the order and see if you can get paid later. Still, it&#8217;s a quick fix without updating the web-to-print extension.</p>
<h3>Solution 2: upgrade ZP web-to-print extension</h3>
<p>The latest beta release 2.0.1.0beta5 has some important changes to the way ZetaPrints generates orders.</p>
<p><strong>We added a new configuration parameter on our web-to-print configuration page.</strong> The ZP order will remain as <em>Saved</em> and not billed for until the payment is confirmed in Magento or manually generated in ZP.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/02/web-to-print-payments.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023" title="web-to-print payments" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/02/web-to-print-payments.png" alt="web-to-print payments" width="508" height="285" srcset="http://www.zetaprints.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/web-to-print-payments-300x168.png 300w, http://www.zetaprints.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/web-to-print-payments.png 508w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>We also changed the way the code responds to <a title="Details on web-to-print / paypal events" href="http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/wiki/PaypalPaymentMethods">internal Magento events</a>.</strong> It should solve the problem with third party payment extensions. We definitely know there problems with customers in Chile, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and some others. Please, upgrade and let us know if we still don&#8217;t play nice with your payments extension.</p>
<h2>Free web-to-print upgrade service</h2>
<p>We are happy to provide a free upgrade service to any affected customers. Please, <a title="Contact ZetaPrints" href="mailto:support@zetaprints.com">let us know</a> your situation.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you everyone for your patience with us.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We noticed that if a PayPal or some other hosted gateway payment is canceled Magento still goes through the checkout, but leaves the web-to-print order as &#8220;pending&#8221;. The problem is that our web-to-print code doesn&#8217;t differentiate by status &#8211; anything that goes through the checkout is processed by ZP, PDF files generated and the billing flag is set.</p>
<p>We cannot charge customers for web-to-print orders they don&#8217;t need, so an update is coming in the next few days. See our <a title="web-to-print issues" href="http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/issues/detail?id=738">issue tracking</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The other option is to install an SSL certificate and process credit cards right on your website.</p>
<p>Contact us if your web-to-print site is being affected by this issue. We should be able to remove those web-to-print orders from your billing. This was never our intention to charge for unpaid orders.</p>

For example a 12-page web-to-print calendar was too slow as the user progressed through the page. Not any more. There is no difference processing page 1 or page 12 or page 20.</p>
<p>PDF generation got a wee bit faster too.</p>
<p>Time to get serious about web-to-print calendars. Let us know if your web-to-print templates are still not fast enough or simply time out. We will try to make them work.</p>
