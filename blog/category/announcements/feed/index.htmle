<p>Before this feature was introduced, customers with &#8220;approver&#8221; status were only able to approve or ignore the order. Now they can clearly <em>decline</em> an order and enable the customer who placed the order to see its <strong>declined</strong> flag in the shopping cart.</p>
<p>This feature is available from extension version <a title="Magento order approval extension" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/order-approval.html">0.2.0.0beta6</a> onwards.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our main website <a title="web-to-print software" href="../../../../index.html">about web-to-print</a> and about <a title="dynamic imaging software" href="../../../../index.html">dynamic imaging</a> got a facelift. It is now using the same theme as our <a title="dynamic imaging and web-to-print help" href="../../../../help/index.html">web-to-print help</a> area.</p>
<p>We also re-arranged the way we call our <a title="web-to-print software" href="../../../../tmpackages/index.html">software packages</a>, but the substance is still the same.</p>
<h2>Dedicated web-to-print and dynamic imaging</h2>
<p>The most significant change is the <a title="Web-to-print and dynamic imaging for enterprise level customers" href="../../../../packages/enterprise-web-to-print/index.html">Enterprise web-to-print offer</a>. If you think you are big enough to justify a separate deployment of a web-to-print system as opposed to our standard <a title="web-to-print SaaS pricing" href="../../../../web-to-print-and-dynamic-imaging-pricing/index.html">SaaS offering</a> we are happy to give you one. There is no definitive price tag because every deployment is different, but it makes sense to do if you pay us more than $4000 a month.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons for standalone deployments:</p>
<ol>
<li>reduced cost on large volumes</li>
<li>security of supply</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, what are you going to do if your SaaS web-to-print provider stops providing the service to you tomorrow?</p>
<p>For some businesses it would be a complete disaster. Having the source code and controlling the hosting adds that level of security and independence.</p>
<p>The software can be deployed on your own servers, but our preference if you rent virtual servers on <a title="Amazon Web Services" href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, <a title="RackSpace Cloud" href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">RackSpace</a> or other established cloud operator.<a href="mailto:support@zetaprints.com"> Talk to us</a> about your big project.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve updated the compatibility of our <a title="Magento order approval extension" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/order-approval.html" target="_self">Order Approval extension</a> and its latest release (<em>0.2.0.0beta1</em> ) is compatible with <strong>Magento v.1.6.1</strong>.</p>
<p>This <a title="Order approval extension for Magento" href="../../../../magentohelp/magento-order-approval/index.html">extension</a> allows you to organize an approval process in a <a title="Magento ecommerce" href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/" target="_self">Magento</a> store and prevent certain customers from checking out until their orders are approved by a nominated approver.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The store administrator nominates one approver per customer. After that, any purchases made by a customer with an approver have to go through an additional approval step. Any items can be added to cart, but only approved items can be checked out.</p>
<p>When a customer tries to checkout, the extension checks for any new unapproved items and sends an email to the nominated approver. The approver can log in, view the list of items and approve the purchase.</p>
<p>Customers without a nominated approver can check out as usual.</p>
<h2>Web-to-print compatibility</h2>
<p>The extension remains fully compatible with our <a title="Web-to-print extension for Magento" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/web-to-print-and-dynamic-imaging.html">web-to-print extension</a> for Magento.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We added a new feature to the web-to-print portals that allows you to get the print-ready files from saved orders faster.</p>

All <a title="Web-to-print order status" href="../../../../help/order-status/index.html">saved orders</a>, that haven&#8217;t had their print-ready <a title="Web-to-print output file generation" href="../../../../help/output-files-generation/index.html">output files</a> generated yet, will have a &#8220;<strong>Generate files</strong>&#8221; link right there on orders list page.</p>

<h3>Magento web-to-print orders</h3>
<p>Magento web-to-print orders added to cart, but not checked out with a payment remain as saved within your ZetaPrints portal. You can locate them via Order Details page in Magento and then use this new link to generate output files.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We made a pretty cool upgrade to the Magento image editor that comes built in our <a title="Web-to-print extension for Magento" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/web-to-print-and-dynamic-imaging.html">web-to-print extension</a> for Magento. Cropping images just became a lot easier and more intelligent.</p>
<p>Your web-to-print templates contain variable images that come in all shapes and sizes. Users will now be able to adapt any image they&#8217;ve uploaded in a way that is relevant to a specific image field shape and size requirements.</p>
<p>The new &#8220;<strong>Fit-in-field</strong>&#8221; tool we&#8217;ve added is basically a smart crop tool that has its selection area shape locked to a proportional shape according to the image placeholder of the template.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fit-in-field_selection.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915" title="Fit-in-field locked crop selection area" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fit-in-field_selection.png" alt="" width="490" height="458" srcset="http://www.zetaprints.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fit-in-field_selection-300x280.png 300w, http://www.zetaprints.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fit-in-field_selection.png 817w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<div style="display: table;">
<p><img style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="New web-to-print menu sections" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/11/menu_sections.png" alt="" width="179" height="588" /></p>
<div style="position: relative; top: 15px; display: inline;">
<p>We split the image editor toolbox menu in two sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Adapt for this field</strong> and</li>
<li><strong>Global changes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The top one introduces this new &#8220;<strong>Fit-in-field</strong>&#8221; tool and any image edits using this tool are used for the active image field only. This means that the same image can be cropped differently for different image fields in a single template.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Global changes</em>&#8221; section, on the other hand, holds the old and familiar tools which change uploaded images for all fields in all the templates.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yet another user-friendly feature is the horizontal shortcuts menu that is included in the &#8220;<strong>Fit-in-field</strong>&#8221; tool interface and allows users to quickly fit their uploaded image in the variable image area of the template they&#8217;re personalizing.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924" title="Web-to-print Fit-in-field shortcuts menu" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/11/web-to-print_shortcuts_menu.png" alt="" width="529" height="139" /></p>
<p><strong>This new image editor feature is included in the latest beta (1.9.2.0beta15) release of the extension and is <a title="Deactivate Fit-in-field image editong feature" href="../../../../magentohelp/activate-fit-in-field-image-editing/index.html">activated by default</a>.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Attention customers of ET Graphics in New Zealand.</p>
<p>As far as we know, <a href="http://www.etgraphics.co.nz/">ET Graphics is no more</a>. They have been liquidated. A number of other printers picked up the tab where they left off.</p>
<p>We suggest you contact <a href="mailto:abc@photosigns.co.nz">ABC Signs</a>. They are good guys and will be more than happy to serve you online using the same web-to-print system (which is us). You won&#8217;t even need to register again &#8211; your details are still there.</p>
<p>We do not know who bought ETG, but since <del>they</del> neither the liquidator nor the new owners didn&#8217;t even bother to update their website and still send all the former customers to us we put this message up. Speaks volumes how much they value you, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
