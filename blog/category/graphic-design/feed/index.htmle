<h2><strong>Variable parameters</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Width:</strong> set to width in pixels or % (in 2 places)</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> set to height in pixels or % (in 2 places)</p>
<p><strong>Data source: </strong> this is an address of RSS feed for the catalog you want to show. The catalog needs to be public.</p>
<h2>What for?</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t ask. It&#8217;s one of those pet projects. Maybe there is some use for it.</p>
<p>The most obvious is to promote your products. Build a catalog with a few simple templates that work well in small size and are fun. Embed the plugin on your site. Ask others to embed it. The user may want to click through to your site and actually order something after playing with these small designs.</p>
<p>Your suggestions on what features to add are welcome.</p>

<p>She&#8217;s got lots of unused illustrations and can sell them on exclusive (up to $500) or non-exclusive (about $30) basis. I told her she can&#8217;t sell the same design to more than one ZP customer, so the non-exclusive will buy an exclusive within ZP <img src="../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We spent a bit of time on improving our <a title="web-to-print tutorials" href="../../../../help/index.html">web to print help site</a> and added a <a title="web to print suggestions" href="../../../../help/suggest-a-topics/index.html">page for your suggestions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Did you see a cool design</strong> somewhere and now want to make a template with something like that? It may be too hard. It may be impossible. Let us give it a try for you and then post a short tutorial on how to get it done.</p>
<p><strong>Did you have troubles with ZetaPrints interface</strong> and think it should be better explained? Tell us where you stumbled and we&#8217;ll post an article to help you through.</p>
<h2>Sourcing designs</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve got thousands and thousands of designs submitted by freelance designers. Some of the good, some not. Soon you will be able to browse them and add the ones you like to your catalogs. The main problem here is the pre-press quality of the designs as most designers concentrate on the visual aspect and totally ignore the technical side of making the final product.</p>
<p>We need help with writing detailed <a title="Web to print guides" href="../../../../help/category/product-guides/index.html">product guides</a> and <a title="pre-press tutorials" href="../../../../help/category/pre-press/index.html">pre-press techniques</a> that explain what the final output should be like, all the pre-press stuff, what information it should contain (fields), etc. Then let the designers try and pitch their designs to you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://webtoprint.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/courier.jpg" alt="Courier Typeface" style="float:left;" hspace="8" vspace="8" />In text type, it&#8217;s important to realize that there is only one space after a period. The two-space habit after a period can be tough for many typists to break; however, those two spaces can tell some people a lot about your inexperience and your age. Plus, those double spaces often create more work for others, unless you are creating documents in <a href="http://www.lowing.org/fonts/" title="Read more">mono-spaced fonts</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for the double space is that in <a href="http://www.monotypeimaging.com/ProductsServices/monospaced.aspx" title="See some fonts">typewriter fonts</a> (or mono-spaced fonts like the one shown), all of the characters are alloted the same width of space, whether it&#8217;s an &#8220;m,&#8221; an &#8220;i,&#8221; or a period. The two paces after a period calls attention to the punctuation mark at the end of each sentence and creates a visual pause that is needed. In digital typesetting, however, the fonts are variably spaced, meaning each letter is encoded with its own space that is different based upon the width of the character. The punctuation is designed to be slightly larger so that it is easily recognizable at small point sizes without that double space. Therefore, one space after a period has been the standard in typeset copy for some time. Stop using double spaces, as you create more work for your editor or graphic designer when they have to go in and remove those extra spaces.</p>

During Roman military encroachment and empire expansion, this alphabet was adopted and spread from England to the north, to Spain in the west, to Egypt in the south, and to the Persian Gulf in the east by the year 100 CE, when the Roman empire was at its height.</p>
<p>The reason why this typeface spread and was adopted was because the Romans used a single language (Latin), one writing style and a consistent government for centuries. A preeminent example of the beauty of structure and weight of the Roman capital letters is seen in the inscription at the base of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan's_Column" title="Read more at Wikipedia">Trajan&#8217;s column</a> in Rome carved in 114 CE (shown here). This inscription is regarded as the finest example of quality chisel-cut lettering and shows the introduction of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif" title="Read more at Wikipedia">serifs</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Color properties can be confusing, especially since many designers use the computer to design for print. Unfortunately, the color associated with computers – RGB – is not the color that is associated with print – CMYK. Here are a few tips to help you remember the difference between the two color systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer color systems use light to portray color, so RGB is Red, Green, and Blue light. This system is also known as <b>additive </b>color mixing, so remember that when you turn on the light, you add color to the computer design process.</li>
<li>Print color systems don’t use light, so CMYK stands for four colors of ink: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Kryptonite (just kidding!). The &#8220;K&#8221; stands for &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model" title="Read more">Key</a>,&#8221; or the black ink that printers use to create values to a true black on paper. Since these inks are added to a piece of paper rather than to a backlit computer screen, the use of this system is known as <b>subtractive </b>color mixing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to remember the difference between the two systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>When RGB lights are mixed together, they create white light (additive).</li>
<li>On the other hand, when CMYK inks (or paints) are mixed together, they create black ink (subtractive).</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, a simple way to convert RGB to CMYK or from CMYK to RGB is unknown. The best the designer can hope for is to use a <a href="http://www.normankoren.com/color_management.html" title="Read more">color management system</a> that uses color profiles that can describe the spaces that are being converted. The conversions will never be exact. This is why it’s always good to design print materials with CMYK systems and images from the beginning, and why it’s good to always use RGB systems and images for Web design from start to finish.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Graphic designers use a flat surface, or a two-dimensional space – to convey their messages to others. This two-dimensional, or 2D, space is a flat plane that consists only of length and width. The only depth within a 2D plane is the illusion of depth created by the designer. This illusion, much like a magic trick, can only work through the successful use of monocular cues.</p>
<p>Monocular cues create the illusion of forms that advance or come forward from the picture plane. The reverse is true as well, where forms seem to recede from the picture plane. Monocular cues are depth cues that result from using only one eye (mono meaning &#8220;one&#8221;). Recently, <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/03/060308212248.htm" title="Read more">scientists have confirmed</a> that the illusion of depth is perceived &#8211; not so much by the eye as it is by the brain. Successful designers use this information to create depth cues. In turn, these cues create the illusion of a three-dimensional (3D) space from a 2Dformat. Some ways to achieve this illusion include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Size:</b> For example, large type in a heading appears closer than small type in body copy.</li>
<li><b>Size and Position:</b> Two pencils are placed next to each other, and one is smaller. The smaller pencil will appear to be further away in distance. On the other hand, if both pencils are the same size and one is placed at the end of a hallway (one point perspective), the pencil placed at the end of the hallway will appear larger.</li>
<li><b>Position:</b> An object placed at the bottom of a 2D picture plane will appear closer than the same sized object placed at the top of that same format.</li>
<li><b>Overlap:</b> When one object is overlapped over an object of the same size, the object on top is perceived as being closer.</li>
<li><b>Values:</b> Darker objects appear smaller than lighter objects; so lighter objects appear closer to the viewer on the picture plane than darker objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>The clues listed above are just a few of the many tricks designers can use to add the illusion of depth to a flat picture plane. In many cases, a designer will use more than one clue to help the viewer understand the depth illusion. Study <a href="http://www.visualillusion.net/" title="Read more">optical or visual illusions</a>, because some of these optical tricks may help you bring your subject ‘closer’ to your viewer in more ways than one!</p>
