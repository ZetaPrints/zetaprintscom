				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Multi-page web-to-print templates can have <a title="Repeating web-to-print fields" href="../../../../help/repeating-fields/index.html">text and image fields shared between multiple pages</a>.</p>
<p>The user can change it only on one page where it is encountered for the first time. All the other pages in the same web-to-print template will reuse the previously entered value.</p>
<p>We had a problem with our web-to-print engine updating pages it didn&#8217;t need to update when the shared fields were involved. If an update failed the user had to start over. This problem has now been fixed.</p>
<p>There is still a performance limitation. If a field spans too many pages with a lot of images it may take too long to update them all resulting in a time-out. Please, let us know if you encounter this situation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are having significant networking problems with patchy packet loss resulting in dropped connections and pages not loading fully. Our magento users are not affected as much because their users see only the magento site, but the problems communicating with ZetaPrints remain nonetheless.</p>

<p>We are trying to resolve the problem with Amazon Web Services at the moment. Unfortunately there is not much we can do.</p>
<p>There are reports of multiple orders being placed by users because they get no response to pressing the Order button. Please, let us know if you were affected and we&#8217;ll adjust the billing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are clearing a backlog of web-to-print a dynamic imaging help posts from the last few weeks. The web-to-print features were released, but not documented on time, so you probably didn&#8217;t even know they are there.</p>
<h2>Combobox</h2>
<p>Let web-to-print users enter text or choose from a list, all in one control. Available in Magento only, for now.</p>
<p><a title="web-to-print combobox" href="../../../../magentohelp/combo-box-functionality/index.html">http://www.zetaprints.com/magentohelp/combo-box-functionality/</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Web-to-print integration into Magento theme changes</h2>
<p>We changed location of some files in our web-to-print extension for Magento, This would be of interest for someone who integrated a theme before and may do it again on another site. Read this help post first: <a title="web-to-print theme integration" href="../../../../magentohelp/custom-theme-integration/index.html">http://www.zetaprints.com/magentohelp/custom-theme-integration/</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Assume you have a <a title="Magento is cool. Magento + w2p is awesome!" href="../../../../magento-web-to-print/index.html">cool web-to-print website</a> and want to promote it. Advertising is one way. Getting links from other websites is another. We just had an offer of both. You may get one too and we want you to skip it. Here is why &#8230;</p>
<h2>Unsolicited email</h2>
<p>The following landed in our inbox some time ago</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #999999;">Sender: efxperrault@gmail.com</span>
<span style="color: #999999;">From: W2PI </span>
<span style="color: #999999;">Subject: Invitation to visit W2PI</span>
<span style="color: #999999;">To: xxxxxxxxxx</span></pre>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #999999;">To help you reach the W2P market in North America... www.Web2PrintIndex.com</span></pre>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #999999;">Reasonable advertising rates and focused traffic.</span></pre>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #999999;">The W2PI Team</span></pre>
<p>It did look like spam, but we checked them out anyway.</p>
<h2>Site analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Incoming links: nil</li>
<li>Traffic: nil</li>
<li>Value: nil</li>
<li>Empty promise: plenty</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/03/web-to-print-traffic1.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-645" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="web-to-print-traffic1" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/03/web-to-print-traffic1-150x150.png" alt="web-to-print-traffic1" width="150" height="150" /></a> <a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/03/web-to-print-traffic2.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-646" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="web-to-print-traffic2" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/03/web-to-print-traffic2-150x150.png" alt="web-to-print-traffic2" width="150" height="150" /></a> <a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/03/web-to-print-traffic3.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-647" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="web-to-print-traffic3" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/03/web-to-print-traffic3-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Your <em>web to print</em> site is not going to get any genuine traffic from them because no one visits them in the first place.</strong></p>
<h2>Leaving you out of pocket</h2>
<p>Their offer is to charge you $375 for 6 months of having your homepage screenshot on their homepage. You need to pay the full amount upfront to some obscure PayPal account <em>﻿Web2PrintIndex@gmail.com.</em> There is a 100% money back guarantee, but you can ask for a refund only after all 6 months run out. Rate your chances. <img src="../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;d better invest it into making free downlodable <em>web to print products</em> and promoting them yourself or getting someone to help you. $375 can buy you at least 25 good templates. By the way,<strong> if you offer freebies you can ask us to wave web to print fees on them as well.</strong> We are always happy to help promote <em>your web to print service</em>.</p>
<h2>How to spot a fake</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check for links to their website</li>
<li>Check for traffic on Alexa.com or Compete.com</li>
<li>Look for proof of the claims they make</li>
<li>Check if the people / companies in testimonials exist</li>
<li>Ask us if in doubt</li>
</ul>
<p>It takes less than a minute to tell if a website is a genuine offer or a fake to rip you off. This website did look genuine at first, until the numbers for traffic, links and other parameters told us a totally different story.</p>
<p>You have been warned <img src="../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>There are 2 main ways of getting your <em>web to print</em> message across in Groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>spam the heck out of them with self-promotional messages</li>
<li>get something interesting in front of them or ask for their opinion</li>
</ul>
<p>Another interesting feature of groups is ability to add group members to your network and send them direct messages. Normally you&#8217;d need some sort of other connection with the person and groups is one of them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, it&#8217;s us. We are back.</p>
<p>This <em>web-to-print blog</em> has been neglected for a long time. Here is something new for you.</p>
<h2>Updated web-to-print help</h2>
<p>We moved all Magento related pages from our core <a title="web-to-print help" href="../../../../help/index.html">web to print help</a> to a dedicated <a title="magento web-to-print" href="../../../../magentohelp/index.html">Magento web to print help</a> site. It should be easier to find information in this new format.</p>
<p>Magento <em>web to print</em> help is not only about web to print. We created a bunch of other extensions to help businesses move from other inferior e-commerce platform. The line up includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>asynchronous file uploader</li>
<li>fixed quantities</li>
<li>access control</li>
<li>order approval</li>
<li>content migration</li>
</ul>
<p>and we are working on one more. This set of extensions is everything a print-related business may need to successfully sell their products and services online.</p>
<h2>Web-to-print directory</h2>
<p>We have an extensive database of web-to-print, design and print &#8211; related websites. Why not share the information with others?</p>
<p>Now the database is taking a new form under <a title="web-to-print directory" href="../../../../directory/index.html">http://www.zetaprints.com/directory</a>. We include websites of other web-to-print providers and also anything useful we encounter as part of our daily routine. A lot of links come from customers, so please, don&#8217;t be shy to <a title="contact us" href="mailto:support@zetaprints.com">share an interesting resource</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you changed your web-to-print portal DNS record to a CNAME?</p>
<p>Change it now or contact us for help.</p>
<h2>New data center</h2>
<p>We are switching to a new data center some time this weekend. Tests are under way right now. Once we are happy and most of the data is synchronized we will change the IP address on<em> zetaprints.com</em> and your web-to-print site will be running off the new location.</p>
<p>A smooth ride is NOT expected. It&#8217;s quite possible we will need to switch back if the new hosting is not working to the plan.</p>
<p>Every switch means a bit of lost data. Although we will automatically synchronize both locations it takes minutes or even hours for all the new files to transfer.</p>
<h2>Possible web-to-print data loss</h2>
<p>Do not upload new templates until an announcement is made that we have moved, if you can wait. If the template can&#8217;t wait it&#8217;s not a big deal to upload. Just be aware it may disappear for some time if it ended up on a wrong server until it is found and placed where it should be. Please, let us know if you are missing any orders, images or templates on Monday.</p>
