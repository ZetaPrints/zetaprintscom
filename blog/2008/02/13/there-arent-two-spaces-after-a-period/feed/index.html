		<description><![CDATA[You are an idiot to say that two spaces tells something about age or inexperience.

Not all fonts are equal.  If its OK to include two spaces for the reason you cite, e.g. because typewriters were monospaced and couldn&#039;t provide the &quot;much needed visual pause&quot; then, technically, anything, including a poorly designed variable font, would require the same &quot;much needed visual pause&quot; if it was missing or inadequate.  

I say issues like this are up to the writer, and not dogmatic pinheads, since the writer is responsible for making sure the message is received.  That includes creative control over whitespace, even when the white space is between sentences and not lines.]]></description>
