		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the new features guys!  in regards to address validation, I&#039;ve heard Clayton Makepeace (internet marketor/Copy writer) say not to bother with them. They can do more harm then good.  He said that basically people know how to enter their own details in correctly. 

They do it all the time online. Remember it off the top of their head. So by introducing validation it can actually prevent sales, when they have an unusual address like &quot;corner of huxton Ave and Boulevard road&quot; where there&#039;s no number. 

Direct marketers still have difficulties with a small percentage of addresses which don&#039;t fit in the rigid characterisation of validation.]]></description>
