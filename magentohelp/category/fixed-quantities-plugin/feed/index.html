				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Magento&#8217;s Connect Manager  doesn&#8217;t support rolling back database changes and removing custom attributes added by the <a title="Magento Fixed Quantity extension" href="../../../fixed-quantity/" target="_self">Fixed quantity extension</a>. Follow these instructions to completely remove the extension.<span id="more-12894"></span></p>
<p>1. Remove extension via Magento&#8217;s Connect Manager<br />
2. Copy <em><a title="Fixed Qty extension uninstall.php file download" href="http://magento-w2p.googlecode.com/svn-history/r1638/branches/ZetaPrints_Fixedprices/ZetaPrints_Fixedprices/ZetaPrints/Fixedprices/uninstall/uninstall.php" target="_self">uninstall.php</a></em> file to the root folder of your Magento installation. The file can also be found in <em>/app/code/community/ZetaPrints/FixedPrices/uninstall</em> folder of your Magento installation.</p>
<div style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Change including path at the beginning of the script if you copied it into another directory or a sub-directory of your Magento installation.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you copied script into &#8220;<strong>media/</strong>&#8221; sub-directory, then change include path to &#8220;<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">../</span>app/Mage.php</strong>&#8221; in the script.</li>
<li>If you copied script into &#8220;<strong>media/tmp/</strong>&#8221; sub-directory (or another sub-directory of &#8220;<em>media/</em>&#8221; directory) then change include path to &#8220;<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">../../</span>app/Mage.php</strong>&#8221; in the script.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, there are URL re-writes (re-directs) in root directory of Magento installation. This means that scripts from root directory are not available. The easiest workaround is to copy the script into a directory without re-writes (re-directs), e.x. &#8220;<em>media/</em>&#8221; directory and fix include path in the script as described above.</p>
</div>
<p>3. Point browser to <strong>uninstall.php</strong> file from your Magento installation</p>
<div style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Example:</p>
<p><em>http://www.your-store-url.com/media/uninstall.php</em></p>
</div>
<p>4. Remove the script from your Magento installation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our free <a title="Fixed quantity extension for Magento" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/fixed-quantity.html" target="_self">Fixed quantity extension</a> for Magento supports configurable products. Here&#8217;s an overview on web-to-print configurable product creation and pricing calculation.<span id="more-12720"></span></p>
<h2>Configurable web-to-print products</h2>
<p>Lets say we have a configurable product made from 3 other simple products, e.g. a <a title="Web-to-print greeting cards guide" href="../../../../help/greeting-cards-guide/" target="_self">web-to-print greeting card</a> that is sold in a few <a title="Fixed quantities for web-to-print" href="../../../fixed-quantity/" target="_self">fixed quantity</a> bulk options and can be printed on cardboard with</p>
<ol>
<li>standard finish (no extra charge)</li>
<li>matte finish ($1 additional charge per card)</li>
<li>glossy finish ($2 additional charge per card)</li>
</ol>
<p>Start by <a title="Create Magento configurable product" href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/tutorial-creating-a-configurable-product/" target="_self">creating a configurable product</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Do not assign a web-to-print template to the configurable product at this time, otherwise you won&#8217;t be able to create the associated simple products from inside the configurable one.</p>
<h3>Assign Fixed Quantities</h3>
<p>Fixed quantities and their prices are to be setup on a super product level, in this case, to the <strong>Configurable product</strong>. Procedure is the same as when <a title="Fixed quantities for web-to-print" href="../../../fixed-quantity/" target="_self">setting up fixed quantities</a> for simple products.</p>
<h3>Assign a web-to-print template</h3>
<div style="display: table;"><img style="float: right;" title="Assign web-to-print template" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/05/assign_web-to-print_template.png" alt="" width="448" height="537" /></p>
<div style="position: relative; top: 15px; display: inline;">After you&#8217;ve setup the configurable product, all the simple products included in it and the fixed quantities, you can navigate to <em>Web-to-print templates tab</em> of the configurable product, select a web-to-print template  and then save your settings.</div>
</div>
<h3>Price calculation</h3>
<p>Before using Fixed quantities on a configurable product, you should understand the price calculation rules involved.</p>
<p>Prices are calculated as a subtotal from the fixed quantity price plus the simple product price multiplied by the quantity number. Ex: Our greeting card is sold in fixed quantity lots of 100 copies for $100, 200 copies for $200 and 300 copies for $300.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a customer chooses a fixed qty option of <em>100 units</em> (for <strong>$100</strong>) and a &#8220;standard finish&#8221;, which is at no extra charge, the final amount will be <strong>$100</strong>.</li>
<li>If a customer chooses a fixed qty option of <em>100 units</em> (for <strong>$100</strong>) and a &#8220;matte finish&#8221;, which is <strong>$1</strong>, the final amount will be <strong>$200</strong> (<em>$100 + 100 copies x $1</em>) .</li>
<li>If a customer chooses a fixed qty option of <em>200 units</em> (for <strong>$200</strong>) and a &#8220;glossy  finish&#8221;, which is <strong>$2</strong>, the final amount will be <strong>$600</strong> (<em>$200 + 200 copies x  $2</em>) .</li>
</ul>
<p>Try it for yourself on this <a title="Magento web-to-print demo product with Fixed Quantities" href="../../../../magento/index.php/featured/configurable-w2p-product-with-fixed-quantities.html" target="_self">demo product</a> in our <a title="Magento web-to-print Demo store" href="../../../../magento-web-to-print/magento-demo-store/" target="_self">demo store</a>.</p>
<h2>Other complex products</h2>
<p><strong>Grouped</strong> and <strong>Bundle</strong> Magento products represent combination of different products, which makes use of <em>Fixed Quantities</em> redundant.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Fixed quantity extension for Magento" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/fixed-quantity.html" target="_self">Fixed quantity</a> data for all products in your store can be setup offline and imported. This enables you to manage your large product inventory much easier.<span id="more-12480"></span></p>
<p>During the extension <a title="Fixed quantity extension for Magento installation" href="../../../fixed-quantity/" target="_self">installation</a> two advanced profiles are added to your Magento system:</p>
<ul>
<li>ZetaPrints Fixed Quantities Export</li>
<li>ZetaPrints Fixed Quantities Import</li>
</ul>
<p>These 2 profiles handle task of importing/exporting fixed quantity data. They can be found in Magento admin section under <em></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>System &gt; Import/Export &gt; Advanced Profiles</em> (until Magento ver. 1.5) or</li>
<li><em>System &gt; Import/Export &gt; </em><em>Dataflow &#8211; Advanced Profiles</em> (after Magento ver. 1.5).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Export Fixed quantities data</h2>
<p>Run <em>ZetaPrints Fixed Quantities Export</em> profile. Export profile will save results in <em>/var/export/fixed_qtys_data.csv</em> by default.</p>
<p>Easiest way to edit csv files is to open them in spreadsheet program &#8211; <em>Excel, OpenOffice</em>. How to open a .csv file in different programs is not discussed here and is program specific.</p>
<p>Each product can have multiple and variable number of fixed quantities. Each fixed quantity consists of several fields &#8211; website, label, qty, price. Therefore row format is as follows:</p>
<table style="width: 100%; color: #000000; text-align: center;">
<tbody>
<tr style="font-weight: bold;">
<td>sku</td>
<td>qty#</td>
<td>label#</td>
<td>price#</td>
<td>default#</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>product sku as set in product settings</td>
<td>number of items that are part of the Fixed quantity</td>
<td>description text that will be shown before each option</td>
<td>the price for the corresponding Fixed quantity</td>
<td>a flag that indicates if this option should be selected by default</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>File used for import/export should be in .csv format and should use default magento settings &#8211; fields enclosed in &#8221; (double quotes) and delimited by , (comma). Something to watch out for is not to have &#8221; in label field or if you must have it, escape it with \ (backslash).</p>
<p>Since each product can have arbitrary number of <em>Fixed Quantities</em> assigned you will need to create enough column headings to suit for the greatest number of FQ imported.</p>
<h2>Import Fixed quantities data</h2>
<p>Run <em>ZetaPrints Fixed Quantities Imort</em> profile. Import profile will look for the <strong>.csv</strong> file in <em>/var/import/fixed_qtys_data.csv </em>by  default. If there is no &#8220;import&#8221; directory in there, you can create one yourself.</p>
<h2>Web to print example</h2>
<p>Business cards and other web-to-print products can only be sold in fixed quantities. Prices for a web-to-print website with hundreds or thousands of products can only realistically be managed through import/export. The easiest way to configure them all is to configure one or two typical products through the admin interface, export the file, edit it and then import back into Magento.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our <a title="Fixed quantity extension for Magento" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/fixed-quantity.html" target="_self">Fixed quantity extension</a> does not create new product types, just adds one or several more options to existing non-complex products. Complex product types have their own rules for price calculation and should not be used with this extension. <span id="more-12369"></span></p>
<h2>Pricing rules</h2>
<p>When creating a product that will have fixed quantities, Magento still requires you to set normal price even though it will not be used in front-end.</p>
<ul>
<li>When at least one fixed quantity is assigned, it overrides any price calculations made in cart and during checkout.</li>
<li>When more then one fixed quantity is created, the lowest price is used as the product price.</li>
<li>When adding a product to cart directly from category view page, the lowest price and quantity is added to cart.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, even if you set prices in <em>Fixed quantities</em> tab you need to set some price value in <em>Price</em> tab, even if it will be ignored. It is does not matter what base price you set &#8211; Magento will use fixed quantity prices.</p>
<h2>Quantity rules</h2>
<p>The extension disables <strong>Qty</strong> field in the store front-end and users are not able to input custom quantity amounts on their own.</p>
<p>Customers can only order one of the listed fixed quantity options per product page visit.  If the customer returns to the same product after adding one option to cart (<em>before order is completed</em>) and adds it once more, the product is added to cart  as   a new item.</p>
<p>A product with fixed quantity is displayed with its unit label in cart and all through the rest of the ordering process &#8211; (<em>ex. 100 Posters, Three hundred posters</em>).</p>
<p>Products with <em>Fixed quantities</em> have the <strong>Qty box</strong> on shopping cart page <em>disabled</em>, preventing customers from being able to input custom values during the checkout process.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12440" title="Magento Fixed quantity shopping cart page" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/01/magento_fixed-quantity_qty_box.png" alt="" width="597" height="421" srcset="http://www.zetaprints.com/magentohelp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/magento_fixed-quantity_qty_box-300x211.png 300w, http://www.zetaprints.com/magentohelp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/magento_fixed-quantity_qty_box.png 597w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></p>
<h2>Redefined classes</h2>
<p>Fixed quantity extension redefines 2 classes:</p>
<ul>
<li> <em>Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Price</em> &#8211; &gt; <em>ZetaPrints_Fixedprices_Model_Fixedprices</em> &#8211; this is where product price information is given.</li>
<li><em>Mage_Sales_Model_Quote_Item &#8211; &gt; ZetaPrints_Fixedprices_Model_Quote_Item</em> &#8211; this class is responsible for product order presentation (<em>in cart, checkout, order details</em>). We need this to present separate options as different items in the cart. Otherwise, adding the same product to cart results in adding larger quantities of it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>We have 3 events that we observe and use:</p>
<ul>
<li> <em>catalog_product_collection_load_after</em> &#8211; this event fires when product collection is prepared (<em>ex. in category view</em>). Here we update product <em>min_price</em>, <em>max_price</em>, <em>minimal_price</em> attributes, to match lowest fixed price, this gives us correct price block in listings.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <em>adminhtml</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li> <em>adminhtml_catalog_product_edit_prepare_form</em> &#8211; remove duplicate input entries. Our new attributes are added to <em>General</em> tab by default. But, since we have a separate tab for them, we have to remove them from <em>General</em> tab.</li>
<li><em>core_block_abstract_prepare_layout_after</em> &#8211; add fixed prices. After admin product edit layout is prepared, we hook and add our tab.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Magento ecommerce platform" href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/" target="_self">Magento</a> is an open source e-commerce platform. We developed an <a title="Magento Fixed QTY source code" href="http://code.google.com/p/magento-w2p/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2FZetaPrints_Fixedprices">open source</a> extension that enables you to predefine and sell your products in <a title="Fixed quantity extension for Magento" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/fixed-quantity.html" target="_self">fixed quantities</a>.<span id="more-12347"></span></p>
<h3>Our free extension</h3>
<p>Our free <a title="Fixed quantity extension for Magento" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/fixed-quantity.html" target="_self">Fixed quantity extension</a> for Magento allows you to preset fixed quantities and prices for products. As a store owner, you may have some products that are intended to be sold in lots (<em>ex. 100, 300 or 500 copies of a business card</em>). It was initially developed for our <a title="Web to print and image generation" href="../../../../magento-web-to-print/">web-to-print customers</a>, but can now be used by any type of Magento storefront.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12350" title="Magento Fixed quantity extension" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fixed_quantity_extension_preview.png" alt="" width="560" height="267" srcset="http://www.zetaprints.com/magentohelp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fixed_quantity_extension_preview-300x143.png 300w, http://www.zetaprints.com/magentohelp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fixed_quantity_extension_preview.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<h3>Mageparts payed alternative</h3>
<p>As an alternative solution, you may also try MageParts’ <a title="Drop-down QTY extension for Magento" href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/drop-down-quantity.html">Drop-Down Quantity</a> extension for Magento. It was tested compatible with our <a title="Web-to-print ZetaPrints extension for Magento" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/web-to-print-and-dynamic-imaging.html" target="_self">web-to-print extension</a> and they offer free support and bug fixes.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Get the installation key from <a title="Fixed quantity extension for Magento" href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/fixed-quantity.html" target="_self">extension page</a> on Magento eCommerce, paste it in the corresponding field of <em>Magento Connect Manager</em> and hit <strong>Install</strong>. Don&#8217;t forget to choose Beta or Stable in the <em>Settings</em> tab of <em>Magento Connect Manager</em>.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<h2>Setup fixed quantities</h2>
<div style="display: table;">
<p><img style="float: right;" title="Magento admin fixed prices tab" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/01/magento_admin_fixed_prices_tab.png" alt="" width="197" height="412" /></p>
<div style="position: relative; top: 15px; display: inline;">
<p>Navigate to <em>Product information page</em> in Magento admin panel and click on the newly created <strong>Fixed quantity </strong>tab in the left vertical menu.</p>
<p>Enable the fixed quantity option for a particular product by choosing <strong>Yes</strong> for the <em>Use Fixed Quantity Prices</em> drop-down menu.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The available editable values are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Website</strong>: website for which the fixed quantity price is valid;</li>
<li><strong>Units</strong>: a label that describes a particular fixed quantity option (ex. Buy a set of 300 cards);</li>
<li><strong>Qty</strong>: Actual quantity of the product that is being sold with this option (ex. 300 copies)</li>
<li><strong>Price</strong>: The price for the fixed quantity amount (ex. $12 for 100 units, $30 for 300 units) &#8211; this price is not related to any other price set;</li>
<li><strong>Default</strong>: choose which price should be selected by default when a customer lands on the product page.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12362" title="Magento fixed quantity prices setup" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fixed_prices_settings.png" alt="" width="589" height="204" /></p>
<h2>Custom options price calculation</h2>
<p>When using custom options on a product with fixed quantities, keep in mind that the custom option prices are calculated per item.</p>
<p>Ex. If you have a fixed quantity of 100 items and a custom option that should cost an extra $100 for the whole lot, the custom option price should be set at $1 (100 items x $1).</p>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>Our fixed quantity extension for Magento is fully compatible with our <a title="Magento web-to-print extension" href="../../../magento/" target="_self">web-to-print</a>, <a title="Magento order approval extension" href="../../../../magento-web-to-print/magento-order-approval/" target="_self">order approval</a> and <a title="Magento access control extension" href="../../../magento-access-control-for-dynamic-imaging/" target="_self">category access control</a> extensions out of the box.</p>
<p>Non complex product types are most suitable for this extension (<em>simple, virtual, downloadable</em>). Complex product types (<em>configurable, grouped</em>) have their own price calculation rules and are not compatible with this extension.</p>
